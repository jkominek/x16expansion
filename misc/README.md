I made a knock-off X16 logo, based on applying a rainbow gradient to a
CC0 butterfly image. https://svgsilh.com/image/1180250.html  The idea is
to hint at being X16 without trampling on their logo/intellectual property.
Do whatever you want with it, the PSD file is also CC0. If I get energetic
I'll remake it as an SVG to make it a bit more generally useful.
